# **App Name**: Cosmic Explorer

## Core Features:

- Data Fetching: Fetch up-to-date data about asteroids, comets, and other space objects from reliable sources such as NASA APIs.
- Interactive Display: Display the fetched data in an interactive and visually appealing format, allowing users to explore object properties, trajectories, and more.
- Search and Filter: Enable users to search for specific space objects or filter the displayed data based on different criteria (e.g., size, distance, orbit).
- AI-Powered tool Explanation: Implement a generative AI-powered tool to explain complex astronomical concepts related to space objects in a simple and accessible language.
- Trajectory Simulation: Provide simulated trajectory visualization of the object in its orbit

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) to evoke the vastness and mystery of space.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#0A0F37), almost black, creating a canvas that allows the data and visualizations to pop.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight interactive elements and data points.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that gives a modern, machined and neutral feel; will be used for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different data categories and interactive functions.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance user experience when exploring data and trajectories.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout that prioritizes data visualization and exploration.
